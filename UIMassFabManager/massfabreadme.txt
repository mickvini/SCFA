version 1

This is a UI mod, you can play multiplayer without your opponents having it too.

Will automatically switch mass fabs on/off to try and maintain your energy levels. Mass fabs need to be set to auto switch with the UI panel due to this being a UI mod. This can be automatically done by right clicking the add all fabs button, but this isn't really recommended due to the workaround I'm forced to take to find mass fabs and keep the mod UI only. It will only update the list while you have nothing selected.

Installation:
extract to your \supreme commander\mods\ folder, and activate the mod in the extras menu.


Updates:
v1: initial release.
