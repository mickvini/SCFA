### UEF
Experimental Assault Thing ( *** )
  * Either in the shape of a large Titan or more humanoid shaped OR a large assault tank.
    * Possibly a two part splitting bot. Cain and Abel or something cool.

Panopticon: Experimental Sensor Array
  * Gives vision of enemy non-ACU non-SACU, non-wall, non-mine, non-cloaked unit that you know about.
  * Has a massive radar radius, which it uses to see choose vision targets.
    * Darkness used to be a hard counter, but with the rework I added a large stealth field, which is a soft counter.

Centurion: Experimental AA gunship
  * I don't like the model.

Ivan: Experimental Drop-Pod Artillery
  * Functionally a factory that deletes the things it makes then adds the unit code to the projectiles which spawn them in the other side.
    * Currently kills units that hit a shield; shield damaged by mass value, plus static drop-pod impact value.
    * Range should probably decrease for large ammos maybe?
    * Possibly pass kills, or a subset of kills, or first kill of the produced units back to the cannon?
    * Units it has in storage have a chance of being spawned under it if it dies, or is reclaimed.
      * Causes an issue related to restarting skirmish games that can result in 'ghost' units appearing in the next game where it was.
        * Caused by spawning objects with the ondestroyed call, which triggers after game end.
    * Gets a 40% discount on built units. Units spawn with 40% less max health.
    * Has no UI representation of what it has ready to fire, but has a visual representation of how much is ready to fire.

Gantry: Experimental Factory
  * Almost completely 100% Fully functional.
    * Still to do:
      * Hook \lua\ui\game\avatars.lua and/or \lua\factions.lua to get the idle icon working.
      * Maybe add some kind of pedestal effect for building aircraft upon, especially on water.
        * Would need to wait for the current unit to be completed, especially if its a ship.
        * Would also need some visual justification for it while not there, or to maybe comprised of energy effects.
      * Add a OnDamaged twitch animation, so it looks like its in pain? Maybe a bit sadistic.
      * The Atlantis gets stuck in it. IssueDive is used to get it out, but it loses its orders along the way.
      * Small non-air units take forever to leave. Maybe use scripts from the Fatboy to quickly move them.
        * Alternatively, why are you wasting your Gantry making junk?
      * The current implementation of the 'build mode' switch prevents it from building units from other modes.
        * Possibly to have it swap modes briefly as a work around?
        * Alternatively, find a UI-only implementation.

### Seraphim
Chappa'ai: Totally-not-a-stargate Experimental Quantum Gateway
  * Requires two to be functional. Duh.
  * Still to do:
    * Add a ferry point icon to make transporting things through it easy.
    * Do a slight rework so that rather than instantly teleporting units that go near it, it tracks them until they have passed through the centre of it.
    * Allow projectiles to warp through.

Experimental Mine? ( *** )
  * To be an experimental for the field engie.
  * Possible functions:
    * Releasing a residual energy signature.
    * Self replicating mines.
    * Damage over time effect.

Iyadesu: Experimental Reconstruction Engineer
*  Formerly Experimental Engineer (Prior to r205)
*  Formerly Experimental Field Engineer (As of r205, removed as 2014-08-08)
*  Formerly Experimental Resurrection Unit (Prior to 2016-08-17)
*  Experimental Reconstruction Engineer
  * Reclaims things to learn their recipe.
  * Can learn up to 8 recipes.
  * Cooks delicious units from its recipes.
  * Gets storage drones for the recipes.
  * Loses its recipes if it loses its drones.
  * Drones help to build.
  * Can potentially circumvent build restrictions, if a map has a wreckage of a restricted unit.

Suthanus: Experimental Rapid-Fire Artillery
  * Fully functioning.
  * Needs a new name for dupe name reasons.

Souiya: Experimental Naval Factory
* Lacks unique model.
* Without other mods it has no experimentals it can build.
* May push it by giving it the ability to make amphibious units, and to protect subs it makes by making them underwater.
* Doesn't appear on idle factory tab.

### Aeon
Absolution: Experimental Siege Tank
  * Mostly finished texture that needs more details.
  * Has its big cannon and two TMD's.
  * Totally isn't an eldar grav tank. Nope nope nope.

Independence Engine: Experimental Air Factory
* Scary AF under AIx control.
* Doesn't appear on idle factory tab.

### Cybran

Iron Curtain: Experimental Shield Generator
  * Used to want the shield to shrink on damage. Not sure anymore.
    * Would need to adapt the force shield script for this.
  * Only one of my experimental shields with a derivative mesh. Would like to change that.

Scathis Mk 2: Experimental Rapid-fire Artillery
  * Uses most of the parts of the original.

Darkness: Experimental Omni Disruption Facility
  * Uses the model of the QAI Mainframe from the campaign.
  * Was briefly called Oscuras before reverting back to Darkness.
    * I realized that any unit for which I try to avoid referring to it by name, has a bad name. Sorry Kris.
    * AI can still call it Oscuras. If they ever actually build it.

Arthrolab: Experimental Land Factory
  * Has no death animation.
  * Doesn't appear on idle factory tab.

Abyss Crawler: Experimental Transport
  * Ferry doesn't work.
  * Need to improve survivability of cargo on death.

## Modded vanilla units:
### All Factions:
T1 landscout
* Gave omni at a range of 2, unlisted in game.
  * Allows T1 scouts that 'walk into' cloaked & stealthed units to see them.
  * There is a chance that units already had this, but never told anyone.

T1 Walls
* Unified build sorting.

T3 Assault/Armored Assault Bots/Tanks
* Unified build sorting.

T3 Mobile Artillery/Sniper Bots
* Unified build sorting.

Experimental Buildings
* Added appropriate build menu sorting.
  * This separates them from the mobile experimentals.
    * Seraphim already did this.

Experimental mobile units
* Made buildable by experimental factories based on size.

Bombers
* Bombers have been granted a 95% damage resistance to weapons that require a computed drop distance (ie, bomber bombs) while they are in the air.
  * This is to prevent bombers killing themselves consistently when they attack the Iron Curtain. Seriously.
  * It actually made the Iron Curtain basically self defending against bombers, because of its coincidentally perfect size.

Torpedo Bombers
* Gave the ability to land on water.

Turrets
* Made buildable by armoured walls based on size.

Support Commanders
* Added an enhancement for field engineer tech.

### Aeon:
T2 Shield Generator
* Allowed to upgrade from my T1 shield gen.
* Allowed upgrade to the T3 shield gen.
* Allowed rebuild bonus on T2 and T3 wreckages.

T3 Shield generator
* Allowed T2 to upgrade into it.

T3 Heavy Assault Bot
* Decreased the cost and stats to be comparable with that of the Titan, the Loyalist, and my Serephim one.

T3 Torpedo bomber.
* Unified build sorting.

T3 Rapid Fire Artillery Installation
* Re-categorized as an experimental.
* Gave it the experimental level health regen.

T3 Quantum Optics
* Reduced build footprint.
* Enabled click-drag build.
* Adjacency effectiveness reduced.
  * It was high enough that it could be reduced to 0 cost, which breaks the script.

Galactic Colossus
* Conditionally increased health by 1 if no other mods change it from 99999.

### Cybran:
ED1
* Changed to Tech 1.
* Reduced health to 100.

ED2
* Changed to Tech 1.
* Reduced health to 200.

ED3
* Made buildable at Tech 2.
* Reduced health to 300.

ED4
* Changed to Tech 3.
* Made buildable at Tech 3.
* Reduced health to 400.

ED5
* Changed to Tech 3.
* Health still 500.
* Cost increased by 50%.
* Gave a third discount on upgrading from ED4.

Jester
* Changed build menu sorting.

Hive
* Second upgrade is now:
  * Tech 3
  * Directly buildable.
  * 4x the cost.
  * Given a 75% discount when upgraded to.

T3 Anti nuke defense
* Changed tarmac.

Scathis
* Removed.
* Replaced with immobile version for both balance and aesthetic purposes.

Megalith
* Added the ability to build the Salem, House, Hedgehog, Slink, and Operative

### UEF:
T2 Field Engineer
* Gave a unique buildable category.

T2 & T3 Shield Generators
* Unified tarmacs textures.
  * For some reason the T2 had a huge tarmac and the T3 had a tiny tarmac.
* Allowed the T2 to upgrade from my T1.

T3 Nuke Defense Silo
* Changed the tarmac texture.

Kennel
* Tech 3 version is now directly buildable.
  * Increased cost by double.
  * Has a 50% cost reduction whilst upgrading from the T2.

Novax Center & Defense Satellite
* Removed.
* Replaced with:
  * A Tech 3 Observation Satellite Uplink & Observation Satellite, which mostly reuses its appearance.
  * A Tech 3 Mobile Satellite Uplink vehicle, with its weapon.

Mavor
* Gave 'strategic' menu sorting.

Fatboy
* Added build category so it can build the Custodian.

### Seraphim:
T2 Shield Generator: Atha
* Allowed the T1 shield to upgrade to it.

T3 Siege Tank
* Set the always upright attribute to false.
* Increased stats and cost to be comparable to that of Brick, Percival and Moldovite.

T2 Sonar
* Allowed it to upgrade into my T3 sonar.

T3 Battleship
* Nuke launcher disabled when nukes are disabled.
  * ToDo: Remove its useless nuke buttons during this time.

## Errors and ideas; stuff to do
* The Atlantis ignores its rolloff orders from the Gantry.
* Wilson lacks treadmarks for its front tracks.
* Zenith has unused bones.
* The Absolution can't hover over units.
  * Other experimentals walk through armored walls.
  * Engine related bug; possibly can't fix.
* Megalith built eggs bug out when at the pop cap. (vanilla bug)
* The Cybran T3 Cloakable Fab pauses its production when the cloak is disabled.
* Add unit orders to the blips of the Aeon Decoy plane, if possible.
  * IssueGuard could be used if the Jammer is replaced with dummy units.
* Nuke mines should have the option to auto explode, but be set to manual from the off.
  * The commands for altering stance aren't accessible from sim.
* Armored walls (and probably other walls) need to be repaired slower.
* New prettier wall script involving a rotator, a slider, and position detection, for diagonals.
* Tech 1 mobile shield generators? (Ella, Parashield, Umbra)
* Find a way to increase static shield radius and maintenance cost increases when built on water.
* Give the Seraphim T3 Gunship a more interesting weapon than the same as the T2.
  * Beam shotgun?
* Create a UI for the contents of the Ivan.
* TeaD: Do something about civi's blocking the teacup.
* UAL0207.
* Landspeeder.
* Hero last stand mode.
* Anti-naval gunship.
* More ways to deploy mines.
  * Field engineer boats and other.
* Aircraft barrel roll.
* Random asteroid showers.
* Have cloaked/stealthed units able to detect when they are detected.
  * Might be easier to implement the other way round; have the omni check on detecting them.
* Team colored lasers.
* Cybran T1 Spy Submarine.
  * https://imgur.com/a/EcghD
* Cybran stealth field sub.
* Aeon T1 Mortar Station.
  * https://imgur.com/a/TKCvF
* Possibly make the ADG look more like the original.
  * https://imgur.com/a/9tbXY
* Turrets.
* Freeze mines.
* Component tower ship.

## Kris' notes on my ideas for further experimental buildings
* My notes on his notes.

Experimental Strat. Def. - Seraphim or Cybran? Much larger range and could return them to sender.
* Return to sender is probably too much for nukes.

Experimental Defense Structures - A UEF one that combines all three seems fine. Also acceptable would be a Cybran one that just ports the Obelisk of Darkness from C&C.
* Maybe attach the torpedo section to the floatation, so its not there when on land.

Experimental Air Staging - This is the only one that I don't have an idea for.

Experimental Resource Storage - Aeon. When it's full on Energy, it emits a shield. When it's full on mass, it emits a Health Regen aura. There are a pile of issues with this, but I just thought it was a cool idea.
* Would need to be careful with the shield, to make sure its not just used as another shield generator, but with slower response times.
  * Also don't want to make the Iron Curtain redundant.
* Health buff aura on mass full, Health regen on energy full.
  * Is this pulling players in the wrong direction? Do we want them to be stockpiling and wasting resources for effect?

Experimental Wall - Seraphim. Firestorm Walls. Also applicable, Stealth Firestorm Walls for Cybran. (i.e, they're invisible until you walk over them and they melt your face).
* Definitely avoids the issue of the fact that experimentals will just walk over them, if everyone is supposed to be able to walk over them.

Experimental Engineering Station - Probably not a good idea now that they've been added to Seraphim (did you ever give them to Aeon?). I don't have any good ideas to make them interesting either (Unless you're mad enough to want to do infinite/super-huge range). Stylistically, it could be a bundle of Nano-Bots for Cybran, some ethereal light bubbles for Seraphim/Aeon, or just bigger drones for UEF.
* Experimental engineering is probably still a terrible idea.

## Blackrobe ideas:
* Walls with personal shields
* A land version of the air repair pad, like of tibsun.
* T1-3 Jammers
* T1 stealth field gen for Cybran.

## Previously documented abandoned ideas:
UEF Doomsday Machine: Experimental Point Defense
  * Was supposed to be a callback to the old TA unit.
    * An uninteresting idea badly implemented. Removed.
    * Was only still in the source files for nostalgia.
      * Removed as of r146
  * Slot eventually filled by Excalibur, which was inspired by the Annihilator from TA, and I would have called that but the vote said Excalibur.

UEF Engineering Facility 'The Pound'
  * A facility that houses a large number of Rover drones.
  * Do you want lag? Because this is how you get lag.

Aeon Restoration Field Generator:
  * Supposed to have been an alternative to the engineering station that Aeon aren't getting.
  * This might make an appearance in R&D.

UEF/Cybran/Seraphim Decoy Planes
  * Staying Aeon only.

Abyssal Persecutor: Experimental Battleship
  * Idea 1:
    * a cross between the Sea Shadow and a Houbei class missile boat.
    * Stealth, and tac missiles.
    * Possible strat missiles.
    * Possible cloak, disabled during firing and or really high power cost.
  * Idea 2:
    * A Battleship with legs.
  * Idea 3:
    * Carrier/battleship. With legs.
    * Unique T3 fighter/bombers.
  * Slot filled by the Abyss Crawler.
  * Removed as of r647.

Aeon/Seraphim Field Engineering Boat & Ships
  * These are likely staying exclusive to UEF and Cybran.
