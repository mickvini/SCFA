      * New tactic: firing 3735 mass Asters at them because you don't have a Mavor.
    * Pods that impact a shield no longer spawn the unit at all.
      * Previously it would spawn the unit then kill it, leaving a wreckage.
    * Units dropped somewhere they can't normally survive are now killed immediately instead of slowly.
    * Impacts now leave reclaimable remains of the drop-pod, which are worth 3 mass.
    * There is now a light flash when it impacts.
    * Fixed the specular texture for the projectile drop-pod.
  * Corrected a bunch of typos in the first part of the changelog.
  * Damage Numbers: A new mod that makes damage numbers appear.
    * Currently only works for your units taking damage.
  * Damage Numbers: Now shows both damage taken and dealt on self, as a workaround for the entity text only appearing for the controller.
  * Damage Numbers: Added a random quantity of spaces (0-5) either side of the number so they are sometimes off center.
  * Independence Engine now only moves its platform for the last 20% of the first unit in its queue.
    * It can't be assisted while the platform is moving, so this is a workaround compromise between function and aesthetics.

  * Independence Engine now has 8 different roll-off points, in the cardinal and primary intercardinal directions.
  * EIO & Logger: Fixed DPS for weapons that have their racks fire together.
  * Created a new tarmac for the Independence Engine, then shrunk it because all the exported files for it were 60mb.
    * They are still 12mb.

  ### 2017-02-16

  * Walls now have tarmacs again.
  * UEF walls now behave correctly when first built.
    * The bug was caused by the UEF built animations. Seriously.
  * Damage test unit now logs terrain type and looks like a 3310.

  ### 2017-02-17

  * UEF T3 walls and gates are now visible from further away.
  * Changelog and mod-status converted into markdown.
  * Mod-status document split into BrewLAN and sub-mods.

  ### 2017-02-18

  * Advanced wall scripts now check if the unit already has a tarmac before giving it a tarmac.
  * All units can now be drag-built. Most relevant for the Iyadesu.

  ### 2017-02-19

  * Restricted the Iyadesu to only being able to build units with a defined tech level.
    * This stops it from learning blueprints the UI doesn't allow it to be given orders to build.

  ### 2017-02-20

  * Gave the Aeon T3 mobile AA two distance models.
  * The distance model of the Iyadesu now matches the current model.
  * The collision model of the Iyadesu is now representative of its size.
  * The collision models of the T3 mobile AA's are now more representative of their sizes.

    * It looks god-awful, but it works. Unlike the Centurion, which bugs out.

  ### 2017-02-21

  * Rewrote the Centurion script.
  * Removed the Centurion's sonar.
    * At one point it was going to have a depth charge weapon, but it got the anti-ASF laser instead.
  * Centurion now has a build cube for its build animation.
  * Created a new texture for the Centurion.

  ### 2017-02-22

  * Expert Camo: Removed most of the textures from the repo.
    * They have the potential to make space requirements spiral out of control.
    * I will provide them externally.
  * Expert Camo: Added 'Default' to the list of terrain types.
  * BrewLAN now runs on original SupCom (specifically only version 1.1.0).
    * By that I mean it no longer crashes it or breaks everything.
    * The degree to which any individual unit works varies substantially.
  * Damage Numbers: Fix for things getting one-shotted.
  * Overhauled the build mode data key assignment for the Gantry. (Build mode shortcut key is B)
    * Overlapping key values are now bumped to the next free value, instead of overwritten.
    * The priority order is Land, Air, Sea for tech 1-3. UEF, Cybran, Aeon, Seraphim for experimental.
    * Still to do: Fix build mode for experimentals putting the Gantry into command mode.
  * Added build mode key shortcuts for newer units that were lacking.
  * Added build mode bindings for building with field engineers.
    * Ran out of free keys for the actual field engineer units, pending a rework of that.

  ### 2017-02-23

  * Finished the rework of the key bindings. Field engineers and advanced resource buildings now have their build keys.

  ### 2017-02-24

  * Expert Camo: Now also works with Sup Com 1.1.0.
  * Atlantis Gantry roll-of script now moved to Gantry. Atlantis hook script removed.

  ### 2017-02-25

  * Decreased the collision size of the Longbow, Alchemist, and Slink.
  * Expert Camo: Overhauled so now, rather than auto generating skins for itself, it can be used as a framework for other mods that just contain the component files for it to assemble for them.

  ### 2017-02-26

  * Removed all the textures from Expert Camo.
  * Added new icons to SCD.
  * Changed the unit prefix of the units added by Paragon Game.
  * Fixed the accidentally broken Gantry building Atlantis.

  ### 2017-02-27 — 2017-03-02

  * Created Arthrolab: Cybran Experimental Land Factory.

  ### 2017-03-03

  * Aeon Experimental Factory now has the Gantry 'stolen tech' function.
  * Gantry 'stolen tech' function split into its own separate util function for all experimental factories.

  ### 2017-03-04

  * Adjusted the balance of the experimental factories:
    * Gantry:
      * Health to 112000 from 88000.
      * Energy to 156750 from 85050.
      * Mass still 9450.
      * Time to 7034 from 12600.
    * Independence engine:
      * Health: 80000.
      * Energy: 315000.

      * Mass: 8790.
      * Time: 6580.

  ### 2017-03-06

  * Fixed the Scarab, which had at some point either lost bones, or gained dodgy bone references.
  * Added raised platform data for the Independence Engine so land units that end up inside it walk on it not in it.
  * All Experimental Factory code now works on original Supreme Commander.

  ### 2017-03-07

  * Gave the ADG a unique type class.
  * Expanded the range of version numbers from original SupCom that the scripts will look for.
  * Increased the max power drain per second of the Scathis Mk2.
    * Actual power drain per shot remains the same.
    * Rate of fire unassisted now increased.
    * Power generators around the Scathis now have no noticeable RoF effect.
  * Resource cost of Scathis Mk2 increased by a trivial amount.
  * Caffe Corretto: New mod for advanced field engineer weapon tech.

    * Found out that the default buff function for damage does nothing.
      * Bypassed the default function.
        * Found out that the ChangeDamage function on a weapon just straight up doesn't work.

  ### 2017-03-11

  * Paragon Game: Fixed civilians not appearing.
  * Added the Cybran T3 Mobile Sensor Array.

  ### 2017-03-12

  * Made Citron leave ground markings behind when it retracts its mast.
  * Allowed units to leave from the sides of the Artholab.
    * Some units look hilarious climbing the side spikes.
    * It is quicker for production to have them leave from the front still.

  ### 2017-03-15

  * Added a placeholder version of the UEF T2 recon aircraft.

  ### 2017-03-19

  * Moved version check omni nerf fix from Darkness script to global buff script.
  * Improved FAF support.
  * Listed the stealth field ability on the Darkness.
  * Drop-pod script now uses the compatibility check version of buffs.

  ### 2017-03-22

  * Bubble Tea: Pillar of Prominence:
    * Fixed it constantly re-generating every shield bubble as a result of removing the beams.
    * Removed the left-over remnants of the beam code.
    * Units that were shielded by one when its shield was destroyed can now be shielded by it again.
      * This bug may have been caused by the above changes and never actually published, but if it wasn't it's fixed now.
    * Now stops generating new shields when disabled by damage.
    * Now stops generating new shields when disabled by a power outage.
    * It is now on the lookout for spontaneous shield outages, and stops generating shields in that case.
      * It now stops its animations and clears its particle effects in these events.
  * Bubble Tea: projected shields:
    * Added the beam effect removed from the projector to the projected shield script, appearing for 5 ticks when damaged.
    * The damage to deal to the projectors is now calculated once instead of once for each projector to damage.
    * The projected shields now check if the damage dealt would be lethal to the parent projectors.
    * Overkill damage resulting from a parent not having enough shield health is now re-distributed among other parents recursively. If there are no other parents the remaining is dealt to the unit.
    * Removed the default code for overkill calculation and regeneration from the projected shields, since they remain on 100% for their lifetime.
    * Projectiles no longer collide with the shields if they have no owners and shouldn't exist.
  * Gantry AIx 2: Fixed a reference to an old non-existent function.  

  ### 2017-03-23

  * Drop-pod remains no longer block pathing.
  * Listed the sonar and torpedo abilities of the Cybran T1 Torpedo Bomber.

  ### 2017-03-24

  * FAF: Fixed the cloakable resource buildings and stealth fields (mobile and building), and all mines, not using the cloak effect when they first cloak.
    * They were actually cloaked, but the script didn't realise.
    * This fix will also work for regular BrewLAN/BlackOps cross-play, since they use the same script.
    * In the case of the mines, they actually cloak on create, not on stop being built, so its graphically inaccurate, but applying the effect on create would look wrong and would revert when its finished being built.
  * Land mines now follow the slope of the terrain. It's *so* satisfying.
    * The Cybran T1 landmine needs its model re-orientating.
  * Drop-pod remains follow the slope of the terrain.
    * They are no longer spawned a random orientation, until I can translate the angles for arbitrary rotations.
  * The cardinal wall scripts now check for bone conflicts after setting bones by type. (This fixes the overlaps in the Aeon T2 wall, and the Cybran T3 wall.)
  * T1 and T2 walls currently also use the slope script.

  ### 2017-03-26

  * Moved the building sloping script from the wall parent class to the top level unit class, and required units have a bp trigger to use it.
    * Gave T1 walls, the T1 Cybran mine, and the Seraphim T3 shield wall the bp trigger.
      * Other mines still use their version of the code, because I don't want to edit 11 blueprints just yet.
      * The Cybran was an exception because it allowed use of the new option to pick axis and inversions, which the Cybran T1 mine and Seraphim T1 wall needed.
  * Bubble Tea: Moved the projector tracking table of bubbles created by the Aeon experimental shield to the unit the shield is covering.
    * This fixes the issue of damage getting split between ALL projectors instead of just the nearby ones.
  * Bubble Tea: Created a workaround for GAZ_UI breaking whenever you mouse-over a unit with a projected shield with enhanced unit-view enabled.
    * Units that could have a projected shield now have a ShieldMaxHealth defined as 1.
      * This only affects things that check there like GAZ_UI. The projected shields don't care.
  * Bubble Tea: Created a new shield mesh for the projected shields.

  ### 2017-04-02

  * Added a new bone positioning script for the UEF T2 wall.
  * Reduced the tarmac size of the UEF T2 wall.

  ### 2017-04-03

  * Moved the bone positioning script to be usable by any unit.
    * Of the walls, the script is still only used by the UEF T2 wall, due to the bone positioning of the other walls.
  * All mines now use the unit.lua defined terrain slope script.    
  * Ivan drop-pod remains now no longer spawn on top of units they land on.
  * Mines built in the water now sink a uniform distance below the surface.
  * Remains from drop-pods that land on flat terrain now have a random orientation again.

  ### 2017-04-04

  * Overhaul of the Experimental factory script backends.
    * They now all share the majority of their functional non-animation based scripts.
      * Each of the experimental factories has the full AI functionality of the Gantry.
  * Independence Engine can now build engineers.
  * AI controlled Arthrolab and Independence Engine can now build any experimental.
  * Independence Engine now only raises its platform for air units.
  * Arthrolab arm movements now more accurately based on unit sizes.
  * Defined minimum and maximum values for all arm positions.
  * Very large units and weirdly oblong units no longer spin in the Arthrolab.
    * Fatboy/Absolution size and shape is the maximum for spinning, as defined by the skirt size.
  * Gantry AIx Hax 1-3: Updated to modify the new linked gantry scripts.
    * This also means that versions 1 and 2 now also work with the Independence Engine and the Arthrolab.
  * Gantry AIx Hax 1: Refactored it so that it only creates one cheat thread per factory, not per factory per unit that factory has ever made.
    * Functionally the same for game purposes.

  ### 2017-04-06

  * Created a model and basic texture for the UEF T2 recon craft.

  ### 2017-04-07

  * Created a new texture for the UEF T2 wall.

  ### 2017-04-12

  * Finished the texture of the UEF T2 recon plane, which was abandoned before between creating the changelog message and actually finishing it.
  * Doubled the air speed of the UEF spy satellite.
    * There is no reason for it to be as slow as its ion cannon predecessor.
    * It is still the slowest aircraft by a good margin.
  * Caffe Corretto: Added a prototype Seraphim T3 disarming point defence.
    * Currently it lacks effects and actual balancing, but it works and its funny.

  ### 2017-04-13

  * Added build description for currently non-existent Seraphim T2 spy plane.
  * FAF related changes:
    * Overhauled the balance matching script
      * It now takes into account any tables you tell it to instead of just mass and energy build costs, build time, and build speed, from the economy table.
      * Newly synced variables:
        * Maintenance cost and kill requirements on T3 transports.
        * T1 Gunship kill requirements.
        * T2 Aeon decoy plane movement stats against the ASF.
        * T3 torpedo bomber transport class.
      * It now has the data to, although not the capacity yet, to set a unit stats to an average of other units stats.
        * This will affect:
          * UEF T2 recon plane for build cost, intel, and transport class.
            * In FAF this means it is cheaper, has better radar, and uses air staging like a T1.
          * Aeon T2 decoy plane for transport class.
    * Added a new launch script which only triggers on FAF which:
      * Allows BrewLAN aircraft to cash into water.
    * T1 torpedo bombers now have AI guard scan variables.
    * T3 torpedo bombers now have unified AI guard scan radii.
      * Seraphim didn't have any, UEF had very large, Cybran had very small.
    * T3 transports:
      * Shields on the Seraphim and Aeon T3 transports are now categorised as transport shields for damage calculations.
      * Transport hover height set to 6, from 3.
      * Weapons are now willing to target from more layers.
  * Fixed the selection offset of the Cybran T3 transport.
  * Changed the build icon sort of the UEF T2 recon plane, so it sorts after Sparky, but before Janus.
  * Changed the unit ID of the Aeon T2 decoy plane to saa0201 from saa0310.

  ### 2017-04-14

  * FAF related changes:
    * FAF only additions:
      * BrewLAN hovering units can now wreckage on water.
    * Balance sync changes:
      * The average code has now been implemented.

  ### 2017-04-15

  * R&D & BrewLAN: Updated threat values.
  * Paragon Game: Fixed the Paragon size categories.

  ### 2018-07-03

  * Novax rework continued:
    * Uplink changes:
      * Now a factory.
      * Cost reduced by value of one satellite.
      * Satellites no longer free.

    * Satellite changes:
      * Fuel is now proportional to map size
        * At full speed it can move 20km on a 20km map, and so on.
      * It is no longer subject to the parent/child interactions.
      * Sensors no longer active before unpack animation finishes.
  * Listed 'Satellite Uplink' as an Ability for the Archimedes.
    * It doesn't actually do anything for the observation satellite, it is assumed to be perma-linked the LOIC.
  * R&D & BrewLAN: Listed 'Satellite Uplink' as an ability for the Panopticon and the dedicated Omni.
    * It doesn't do anything for these yet, but for these it will.

  ### 2018-07-05

  * Novax rework continued:
    * Uplink changes:
      * Units with the uplink category now have a defined capacity for satellites.
      * If the capacity is exceeded no more can be built.
      * If no units with the category exist, satellites requiring uplink enter 'unstable orbit' mode or just die if unstable orbit mode is undefined.
      * Novax Centre has a capacity of 2.
      * Archimedes has a capacity of 0.

  * Units now survive the Abyss Crawler dying, and are placed better when unloaded.
    * The placement on unload is a workaround and still has units placed in odd places for a tick.
  * Removed the ferry button from the Abyss Crawler.
    * Until I can find a way to remove the requirement of units having the category 'AIR' to set up ferry points,
      there is no point in having the button. Having the category will mean a portion of AA can target it,
      which negates half of the reason for the unit.
    * It can still assist ferry's set up by other units.

  ### 2018-07-19

  * R&D: Added a currently unnamed Cybran Experimental Tank, which is the Abyss Crawler, but with guns instead of transport arms.

    * If I ever re-visited the idea, I'd start from scratch anyway.
  * Gave the Retributor the ability to disable the main weapon.
  * Fixed R&D breaking field engineer exclusivity.
  * Gave the Iyadesu the Sacrifice ability.
      Why did I do this
      How damn sleep deprived am I?
      Fuck it; I need sleep.
  * Removed the Sacrifice ability from the Iyadesu again. That is an Aeon ability.

  * Fixed the observation satellite in FAF. This involved removing some code made redundant by the round-vision fix.
  * Bypassed the AShieldStructureUnit to prevent FAF from forcing bullshit on the Aegis and Pillar of Prominence. Who thought forcing specific animation scripts was a good idea? Honestly.
    * This doesn't make the Pillar work on FAF, but it does fix one if its new issues on FAF.
  * Changed Author credit on mod_info docs, because FAF truncates after any kind of punctuation for some reason, and it was crediting me by my first name alone.
  * Incremented the version number and UID of Crystal Hill, Paragon Game, TeaD, Waterlag, Gantry Hax 1-3, BrewUI, Pulchritudinousity, CrateDrop, and Lucky Dip.

  * Heavy functional change to the Panopticon:
    * It now has radar radius of 6000 instead of 1200.
    * Increased base energy consumption to 10000, from 5000.
    * It now uses its current radar radius as its max view distance, instead of 8000.
    * It can no longer spy on support commanders.
    * It now uses only your own intel to decide what to view. This means:
      * Better performance:
        * Formerly, for each opponent, it would use that players intel, filter out units that that player didn't control and cloaked units, and add those units to its list. Then check again at a larger radius (its radius + Darkess stealth field radius) for Darkness facilities, and check the distances of units on the first list to Darkness facilities list, and remove any too close.
      * It now respects stealth:
        * There is no easy way of checking if a unit is affected by a stealth field in script, only if it is emitting a stealth field. This means in the old system it would have needed to something similar to the Darkness check for each stealth field generator. Now that it only checks your own intel it doesn't know about stealthed units or units in stealth fields to begin with.
      * Darkness facilities no longer get free immunity to the Panopticon:
        * If the Darkness loses power or you get intel on its location some other way, standard game rules on intel apply; its a building and its not going anywhere. It gets spied on.

      * It has a limit of 8 drones.
    * It now also has the ability to rebuild destroyed buildings in the same way as the SACUs.

      * There are 81 dialing addresses. Gates near enough to one another will have the same address. This changes nothing.
    * Units dying on impact on the iris now award kills to the gate.
    * Fixed a bug that may or may not have existed before which bricked gates if you just re-dialed another gate.

## 2015-09-05|0.7

* Fixed the third arm and thread accumulation of the Darkness.
* Fixed the first arm on the distance model of the Darkness.
* Changed the Darkness to use the default buffs system for applying its debuffs. This has the following effects:
  * Effect is no longer affected by distance.
  * It no longer has to specifically tracks units. Meaning it no longer crashes crash when one of them dies before it does, and uses less system resources.
  * Its now multiple stacking buffs with a duration, rather than defined specifically each time.
  * Units leaving the area will now eventually lose the effect.
* Fixed a bug in the vanilla buff definitions that references RADAR radius instead of OMNI radius when calculating the base size of omni buffs.
  * Unfortunately this causes log warnings every time the a unit with a omni buff has its buffs change. But that is to do with how bad the vanilla code is.
* Darkness now stops firing pulses when it doesn't have power. To some degree.

  ### 2015-09-06

  * The observation satellite station no longer goes through the satellite re-spawn motions when its trying to die.

  ### 2015-09-11

  * Added a hat attach bone for the observation satellite.
  * Crates: Changed the vision buff to use actual buffs, rather than an attached vis entity.
  * Crates: Changed the health buff to use actual buffs, rather than just multiplying the units health. They now stack with other buffs like upgrades and veterancy rather than being replaced by them. Buff is now x1.5 rather than x2.
  * Crates: Clones now get a copy of the original units buff table, and then have their current health set to that of the original.
  * Crates: Kills drop now only gives kills to units with defined veterancy levels, and gives an amount of kills at random from the units veterancy levels table.
  * Crates: Added a radar buff. Only activates if the unit has radar. Buff is 25%.
  * Crates: Added weapon buff. Adds 10% to damage and aoe, and 25% to max range. Only applies to units with damage dealing weapons that aren't death weapons.
  * Crates: Added movement speed buff. Value is 20%. Only applies if the unit isn't movement type 'RULEUMT_None'.
  * Crates: Added build rate buff. Buff is x2. Only applies to units with a build speed.
  * Crates: Added 'Jackpot' variations of each buff, which are an order of magnitude more powerful, and have a 1% chance of replacing the original.

  ### 2015-09-12

  * Crates: Removed the damage radius buff from the crate weapon buff. Because the function to set damage radius doesn't exist. Its another bugged buff.
  * Crates: Fixed the weapons check on the weapons buff.
  * Crates: Changed the free mass drop to check available storage. Rerolls if less than 5K remaining storage. It now gives 10% of remaining storage worth of mass, or 5000 mass, which ever is bigger. With a 1% chance of outright filling your storage.
  * Crates: Added floating text box messages to drops. They use default language strings so I don't have to get translations done. Also means some are a bit odd.
  * Paragon game: More intelligent placement of units after the paragon:
    * It now tries to spawns the shields near where it actually spawned the paragon, rather than where it tried to spawn the paragon.
  * Crates: No longer freezes the game if it can't find a safe place to warp to. Warps to the same place instead. Which can have hilarious consequences.

  * Added the UEF Artillery Defense Grid.

  ### 2015-07-27

  * Minor aesthetic change to the ADG. It now does lizard eyes. I can't for the life of me work out what type of lizard it reminds me of.

  ### 2015-07-29

  * Made the ADGs 'eyes' stop moving more often.
  * Airborne bombers of the same type on the same team can no longer damage each other.
    * This most specifically deals with the fact that a group of bombers attacking an Iron Curtain will almost certainly all kill eachother with their own bombs impacting the shield, but also affects experimental bombers hurting each other all the time when in groups.

  ### 2015-08-01

  * Overhauled the previous Iron Curtain bomber self damage fix.
    * Rather than doing a load of self and instigator checks on damage to make sure this only effects bombers of the same type on the same team that are also in the air it now does the following:
    * The damage type of each weapon with the variable NeedToComputeBombDrop that has the DamageType 'Normal' now has the damage type 'NormalBomb'. This includes all bombers' and fighter/bombers' bombs except corsair which doesn't bomb strictly speaking. This is computed during launch.
    * When taking the damage the following checks are made:
      * Am I a bomber?
      * Am I in the air?
      * Is the damage type NormalBomb.
    * If the answer to all those is yes it takes 5% damage instead.
      * This can still lead to a clumped group of 30 UEF T1 bombers damaging the bombers at the back of the group to half health
        * This is preferable to killing the whole group, whilst also giving some feedback on the bombers flying through the fire.

  ### 2015-08-05

  * Centurion changes:
    * Speed reduced from 15 to 9. (Still faster than the Soul Ripper, which is 8 I think)
    * The main flak cannon can no longer fire at ground targets.
    * Fixed the forever broken, but always existent, rear AA laser.
    * Added an additional light Gatling cannon to the underside of the tail for air-to-ground attacks. DPS ~320.
    * It can now wear a hat.
  * Paragon game: Fixed an issue where the script would crash after failing to give someone a Paragon or shield due to map issues. The player will still be Paragon or shieldless, but the game will log a warning and carry on with life.

  ### 2015-08-07

  * Paragon Game: If the script couldn't spawn a unit it will now try again a little bit closer to the players starting location. (Except for people in the center of the map.)
    * If ANY player doesn't have the unit after these checks, it will try a third time (or second time in middle people cases) to spawn, but this time right on their starting location.
      * If the Paragon fails to this point, the shields will also be spawned this way.
      * Players who have STILL been failed by the spawn script, will have the failure announced on their behalf. So people know the game is ruined and that you should all try a different map.

## 2015-01-02|0.6

* (Mostly) Finished the Seraphim Quantum Gateway.
* Added nuke mines and mobile nuke defenses to the restricted nuke units.

  ### 2015-01-14

  ### 2015-01-16

  * Paragon Game: Now does a civilian check, so they no longer break team calculations.
  * Crystal Hill: Now does a proper civilian check, so a real player (human or ai) called 'civilian' for some reason can now get the first capture.

  ### 2015-01-19

  * Made the additional build cats script marginally more efficient when dealing with units that have lost their ability to build from other mods.
  * Added the Cybran T1 Light Torpedo Bomber. The last of the currently planned T1 units now exists.
  * Altered the menu sort priority of the Jester, so it matches that of the Wailer, and appears between the torpedo bomber and transport.

  ### 2015-01-21

  * The Seraphim Optics Tracking Facility now targets the closest unit to the center of the chosen location, instead of the first indexed unit, and now charges for new targets based on the distance between them.

  ### 2015-01-23

  * Seraphim Optics Tracking Facility changes and fixes:
    * Increased the range at which the Seraphim optics tracker gets a discount on range
    * Fixed the discount so it is what is charged, instead of an additional cost.

    * Tech 3 version now costs double, but is directly buildable.
    * The tech 2 version gets a 50% discount on upgrading to it, so its functionally the same that way.
    * Building it directly results in a net profit of 50 mass and 250 energy compared to upgrading to it.
  * Cybran Hive changes:
    * Third level of it is now tech 3, costs 4 times as much, and is directly buildable.
    * The second level gets a 75% discount on building it.
    * Building it directly results in a net profit of 20 mass, and a loss of 700 energy compared to upgrading to.

  ### 2015-02-16

  * Gantry Hax 1: Added an upper limit to the build speed of the AIx Gantries.
  * Fixed the triple notification bug on the 10 minute marker in paragon game.

  ### 2015-03-01

  * Experimental Icons Overhaul: Did a slight overhaul of the detection for weapon based icons, and changed the priorities for others.
  * Experimental Icons Overhaul: Fixed the check for nuke based weapons, since they don't use the 'damage' attrib, the Yolona Oss was showing as direct-fire which is the default for things involved in the damage off checks.

## 2014-12-29|0.5.9

* Created a work around for the heavy walls losing their path blocking when a building on top of them dies or is removed.
  * All things build able on the wall that would cause the issue now have their footprints modified so they only take the center of the path blocking, which doesn't matter.

* All Centurions now have this behavior, not just Gantry built Centurions.
* Disabled the original Scathis again.

  ### 2014-12-23

  * The AI's Centurion pancake script now checks how many times they have failed against each Paragon.
    * They will only try to pancake a Paragon once per half of the level of completion of the Paragon, or if they have more in the squad than the total number that died trying.
  * The pancake script now also checks the maximum speed of the Centurion, and adjusts the ideal kill angle estimation appropriately.
    * For if I adjust the Centurion speed again, and if I apply the script to other experimental fliers.
  * Increased the air speed of the Centurion from 12 to 15. (Original 18)
  * Added a work around for removal of things on walls sometimes causing it to lose its path blocking if the removed thing had the same or larger footprint.

      * It is also back to its old unit code for compatibility with other mods.
      * This also fixed the bug whereby with BrewLAN disabled the Scathis icon was still the Scathis Mk 2.
      * And a bug whereby the rebuild bonus wasn't working due to it referencing the current (and original) unit code.
    * The Cybran Shields, and tech 1 shields are no longer buildable with no Bubbles (Assuming you are running a version for which no-bubbles isn't bugged.)

  * Script for handling sweeping changes of categories is now slightly more efficient.
  * Crystal Hill now removes civilian buildings from the direct center of the map, and spawns the crystal in the exact position of the first of those buildings, if there were any.
    * However the script no longer cares if anything else is blocking the location, or if the ground is flat.
    * This is better for maps where uneven terrain would make the crystal appear nearer one player.
    * The crystal sometimes has its underside visible.

  * Fixed the particle effects of the Aeon decoy.

  ### 2014-10-01

* Changed the gate sections to be a separate building to the wall sections instead of an upgrade of the afforementioned.
  * As much as I preferred the lack of UI clutter it being an upgrade came with, it had three unfortunate side effects:
    * It occasionally broke adjacency script for them.
    * You couldn't have them in templates.
    * It made the gate sections be repaired virtually instantly by anything. (They both still repair to fast anyway.)

  ### 2014-09-18

  * Added a seraphim quantum optics variant.
    * Currently not very variant-y. That is a word now.
  * Fixed the size category for the Aeon Quantum Optics. It was set to size 4, so you could make it free with T1 power plants, but if you did it broke it.

  ### 2014-09-19

  * Changes to the Seraphim quantum optics variant:
    * Reclassified as a 'Optics Tracking Facility'.
    * Renamed and given unique text strings.

  ### 2014-09-11

  * Made the cybran armored wall not trigger the idle factories list.

  ### 2014-09-12

  * Changed the build list for the Cybran T3 wall to have a different wall.
    * This different wall has a smaller base and cant build.
  * Fixed the distance mesh for the Iron Curtain, that has been miss-linked since the B-S unit code change.
  * Changed the T2 adjacency buffs from T2 storage with size 12 and size 20 buildings, to account for the gaps they will always leave. Although there are no size 20 buildings that care anyway.
  * Changed the Cybran T2 wall to be larger, and use the cardinal directions code. Currently uses the stripped down T3 mesh.

## 2014-08-31|0.4.B

  * Hades now deals damage when it dies, equal to its power drain, or calculated power drain if its not firing, at a proportional radius of up to 3.

  ### 2014-09-04

  * Minor performance improvements for the Gantry whacky wailing inflatable arms flailing script.
  * Minor change in Gantry flailing arm speeds.

* Removed the fake Fatboy, Atlantis, and Centurion.
* Made the real Centurion buildable by engineers.
* Removed the part of the script that was making the Fatboy and Atlantis Gantry only. (Also effected experimentals from BlackOps and Total Mayhem)

  * Created a ghetto work around for the Atlantis getting stuck in the Gantry. Very ghetto fix.

  ### 2014-08-27

  * Created a script class for the UEF engineering resource generators, so there is less copied code.
    * Script now checks how far away the instigator is, and does nothing if its too far away, then checks the instigator layer instead of its categories when deciding what to build.
      * Too far away is considered over x3 its visual range.
      * If the units layer is water it alternates between trying to build a torpedo or point defence, in case it can't reach the water for a torpedo.
  * The Engineering Power Generator now aims with all its arms, instead of just the first.
  * Fixed a long standing bug with the Gantry being able to have its costs reduced, through adjacency, to 0 of any one resource.
